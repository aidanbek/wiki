Intentionally dropping/rejecting requests under overload. Protects system from collapse - degraded service better than none. Strategies: random drop (simple), priority-based (preserve critical traffic), adaptive (based on latency/error rate), graceful degradation (reduce features, not availability). Implementation: rate limiting, circuit breakers, load balancer health checks. Response: 503 Service Unavailable, Retry-After header. Better чем queuing unbounded (growing latency, memory exhaustion). Requires clients handle retries gracefully (exponential backoff). Monitoring: rejection rate alerts.
