High percentile latencies (p95, p99, p99.9) - outliers affecting user experience. Average latency misleading - hides bad cases. Causes: GC pauses, CPU throttling, network retransmits, lock contention, queueing delays, slow dependencies. Impact: amplified в fan-out systems (p99 becomes median if 100 backends). Mitigations: timeouts, hedged requests (send duplicate to another server after delay), canary requests (test before full fan-out), tail-tolerant algorithms, avoid variability (no batching). Monitoring: percentile histograms, not averages. SLOs typically p99-based.
