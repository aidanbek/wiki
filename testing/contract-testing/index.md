Verifying API contracts between consumer and provider. Consumer-driven: consumers define expectations, providers verify implementation. Pact pattern: consumer generates contract (expected requests/responses), provider validates against contract. Prevents breaking changes, enables independent deployments в microservices. Faster and more reliable чем integration/E2E tests. Tools: Pact, Spring Cloud Contract. Contract stored в repository, versioned. CI integration: consumer tests generate contracts, provider tests verify. Replaces extensive integration testing между teams.
