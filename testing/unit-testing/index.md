Testing individual functions/methods/classes в isolation. Smallest testable parts, fast execution (milliseconds). Principles: one assertion per test, descriptive test names, AAA pattern (Arrange-Act-Assert). Coverage target: 70-80% (100% unrealistic). TDD approach: write test first, implement code, refactor. Benefits: early bug detection, documentation, refactoring confidence, design feedback. Frameworks: JUnit, pytest, Jest. Run locally + on every commit (pre-commit hooks, CI). Foundation of testing pyramid.
