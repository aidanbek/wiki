Tooling around OpenAPI specification. Swagger UI: renders interactive API documentation. Swagger Editor: design APIs. Swagger Codegen/OpenAPI Generator: generate client SDKs, server stubs. Swagger Hub: collaborative API design platform. Brand confusion: Swagger rebranded to OpenAPI (spec), Swagger remains tool suite. Popular для REST API documentation, reduces developer onboarding time.
