Authorization framework для delegated access. User grants third-party app limited access без sharing password. Roles: resource owner (user), client (app), authorization server, resource server. Flow: authorization code (server-side apps), implicit (deprecated), client credentials (service-to-service), PKCE (mobile/SPA). Access tokens (short-lived), refresh tokens (long-lived). Scopes define permission granularity. OAuth 2.0 standard, OpenID Connect adds authentication layer. Prevents password anti-pattern.
