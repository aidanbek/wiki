Separate deployments для different stages: development (unstable, frequent changes), staging/QA (production-like, testing), production (live users). Additional: sandbox (experiments), performance testing, DR environment. Isolation prevents dev changes affecting prod. Parity important: staging близко к prod (same OS, dependencies, infrastructure) для accurate testing. Challenges: cost (multiple environments), data management (prod snapshots в staging, PII scrubbing), keeping synchronized. Infrastructure as Code ensures consistency.
