GitLab's built-in CI/CD via .gitlab-ci.yml. Pipeline stages: build, test, deploy. Runners execute jobs (shared или
self-hosted). Features: Docker-in-Docker, artifacts, caching, environments, manual approvals. Variables для secrets,
conditional jobs (branch, tag, schedule triggers). Merge request pipelines, review apps (ephemeral environments). Auto
DevOps templates для common stacks. Integrated with GitLab registry, K8s deployments. Simpler setup чем Jenkins (no
separate server), но GitLab-specific.
