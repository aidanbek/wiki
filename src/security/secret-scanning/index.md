Automated detection secrets committed to code repositories. Scans for: API keys, passwords, certificates, database credentials, OAuth tokens. Tools: GitGuardian, TruffleHog, GitHub secret scanning. Pre-commit hooks prevent secrets entering repo. Post-commit: scan history, alert on detections, rotate exposed secrets immediately. False positives common (test keys, placeholders). Secrets management tools (Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) preferred over env vars/config files.
