Practices: disable unnecessary services, remove default accounts, enforce strong passwords, apply security patches, configure firewalls, enable audit logging, filesystem encryption. Baselines: CIS Benchmarks, STIG (Security Technical Implementation Guides). Automated via configuration management (Ansible, Chef). Regular compliance scans. Immutable infrastructure simplifies (replace vs patch).
