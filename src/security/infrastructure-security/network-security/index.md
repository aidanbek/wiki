Protecting infrastructure via network controls. Defense в depth: perimeter firewall, internal segmentation, host
firewalls. VLANs isolate traffic, VPNs secure remote access. IDS/IPS detect/prevent attacks. DDoS mitigation (rate
limiting, scrubbing centers). Zero trust networking replaces perimeter model. Microsegmentation limits lateral movement.
Network policies в Kubernetes. Regular vulnerability scanning, penetration testing.
