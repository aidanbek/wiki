Systematic identification potential security threats during design phase. Methodologies: STRIDE (Spoofing, Tampering,
Repudiation, Info Disclosure, DoS, Elevation of Privilege), PASTA, DREAD. Process: decompose system (data flow
diagrams), identify threats, assess risk, define mitigations. Earlier detection cheaper чем production fixes. Documents:
threat model diagrams, risk register. Updated при architectural changes. Involves security + engineering teams.
