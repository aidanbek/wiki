Encrypting data during transmission: TLS/SSL for web, VPN tunnels, encrypted message queues. Protects against network eavesdropping, MITM attacks. End-to-end encryption best (sender → receiver, not just transport). Certificate validation prevents impersonation. Modern standards: TLS 1.3, strong cipher suites (AES-256-GCM). Disable weak protocols (SSLv3, TLS 1.0/1.1). Performance impact negligible with hardware acceleration.
