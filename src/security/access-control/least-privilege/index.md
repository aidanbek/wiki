Granting minimum permissions necessary для job function. Reduces blast radius при credential compromise. Implementation:
default deny, explicit grants, regular access reviews. Time-bound access (just-in-time) для admin operations. Principle
of separation of duties (no single person has end-to-end control). Challenge: balancing security с productivity. Audit
logs track privilege usage.
