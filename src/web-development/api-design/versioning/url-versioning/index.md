Version в URL: /v1/users, /v2/users. Most common, explicit, simple. Browser/tooling friendly. Drawback: proliferates
endpoints, seems non-RESTful (resource identity changes). Major versions only (v1, v2), not minor (v1.2 - use additive
changes). Supports parallel versions (gradual migration). Clear deprecation timeline.
