Decentralized API management без central gateway. Service mesh handles routing, security, observability at network
layer. API mesh extends concept to APIs: federated governance, schema stitching (GraphQL), policy enforcement at edge.
Vendor examples: Apollo Federation, Apigee API Hub. Benefits: avoid gateway bottleneck, independent team deployments,
polyglot APIs. Challenges: distributed complexity, governance harder. Emerging pattern for large-scale microservices.
