Pattern для querying data spanning multiple services. API composer queries services, joins results в memory. Use case: product details + inventory + reviews from separate microservices. Challenges: performance (sequential calls slow - parallel fetching), partial failures (fallback strategies), data consistency (eventual). Alternatives: CQRS (materialized views), GraphQL (client-driven composition), BFF. Trade-off: flexibility vs complexity. Caching compositions helps performance.
