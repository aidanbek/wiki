REpresentational State Transfer architectural style. Principles: client-server separation, stateless (each request self-contained), cacheable, uniform interface (HTTP methods semantics), layered system. Resources identified по URLs, manipulated via HTTP methods: GET (read), POST (create), PUT (replace), PATCH (partial update), DELETE. Status codes convey meaning (200 OK, 201 Created, 404 Not Found, 500 Error). HATEOAS (Hypermedia As The Engine Of Application State) - responses include links для navigation. JSON typically, XML legacy. Idempotency: GET, PUT, DELETE safe to retry.
