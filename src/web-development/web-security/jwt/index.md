JSON Web Token: compact URL-safe token format. Structure: header (algorithm) + payload (claims) + signature (HMAC/RSA). Self-contained (stateless validation), no server-side storage needed. Claims: iss (issuer), sub (subject), exp (expiration), iat (issued at). Use cases: API authentication, SSO. Risks: token theft (XSS), no revocation mechanism (short expiry helps), payload visible (base64, not encrypted). Store в httpOnly cookies (XSS protection) или localStorage (CSRF protection). Refresh tokens для long-lived sessions.
