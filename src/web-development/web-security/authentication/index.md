Verifying user identity. Methods: username/password (weakest), MFA (something you know + have/are), SSO (Single Sign-On), passwordless (magic links, WebAuthn). Session-based: server stores session, cookie contains session ID. Token-based: JWT/OAuth tokens, stateless server. Password storage: bcrypt/Argon2 hashing, salted. Account lockout after failed attempts, CAPTCHA prevents brute force. Password reset via email token (time-limited, single-use).
