Gateway patterns: aggregation (fan-out requests, combine responses), orchestration (business logic coordination), offloading (SSL termination, compression), caching proxy. Anti-patterns: fat gateway (too much logic - move to services), chatty interfaces (multiple calls - design coarser APIs). Backend for Frontend (BFF): separate gateways per client type (mobile, web, partner) - optimized payloads. Strangler Fig: gradually migrate monolith за gateway.
