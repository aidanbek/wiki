Also known as ADR (Architecture Decision Records). Documents significant architectural choices: context (why decision
needed), considered options, decision made, consequences. Lightweight format (markdown), version controlled. Immutable -
new ADR supersedes old (shows evolution). Makes implicit knowledge explicit. Aids onboarding, prevents revisiting
settled debates. Template: title, status, context, decision, consequences. Numbered sequentially.
