Accumulated suboptimal technical decisions: quick fixes, outdated dependencies, missing tests, poor documentation. Слows
development velocity over time, increases bug rate, makes onboarding harder. Quantification: estimate effort to fix,
impact on productivity. Management: regular refactoring sprints, Boy Scout Rule (leave code better), debt register
tracking. Trade-off: short-term speed vs long-term maintainability. Unmanaged debt eventually forces costly rewrites.
