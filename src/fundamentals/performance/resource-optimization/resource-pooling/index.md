Pre-allocating and reusing expensive resources: database connections, threads, HTTP clients, buffers. Reduces overhead от creation/destruction. Pool размер: balance between resource utilization и concurrency needs. Strategies: lazy creation (grow as needed), pre-warming (allocate upfront), max limit (prevent exhaustion), idle timeout (shrink during low load). Synchronization required (lock-free queues preferred). Connection pools critical для database performance - creating connections expensive (auth, handshake). Thread pools prevent thread explosion, context switch overhead.
