Simulating high user load для evaluating performance, stability, scalability. Metrics: throughput (requests/sec),
response time (p50, p95, p99), error rate, resource utilization. Types: load (expected traffic), stress (breaking
point), spike (sudden surge), soak (sustained load for hours/days). Tools: JMeter, Gatling, Locust, k6. Identifies
bottlenecks (CPU, memory, database connections), capacity limits. Run regularly before releases, после infrastructure
changes. Results inform scaling decisions, SLO targets.
