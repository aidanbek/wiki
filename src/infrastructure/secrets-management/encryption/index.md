At-rest (stored data) vs in-transit (network). Symmetric (AES) vs asymmetric (RSA). Key management critical (HSMs, KMS).
Envelope encryption: data encrypted с data key, data key encrypted с master key. Compliance often requires encryption (
GDPR, HIPAA). Performance overhead minimal на modern hardware.
