Real-time processing unbounded event streams. Low latency (milliseconds to seconds), continuous computation. Frameworks:
Kafka Streams, Flink, Spark Streaming. Windowing для aggregations, watermarks для late data. Use cases: fraud detection,
real-time analytics, alerting. More complex чем batch (state management, exactly-once semantics).
