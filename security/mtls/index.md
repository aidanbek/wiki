Mutual TLS authenticates both client and server via certificates. Standard TLS only server authenticated. Use cases: service-to-service auth в microservices, API authentication, zero trust architectures. Certificate management complexity (issuance, rotation per service). Service mesh (Istio, Linkerd) automates mTLS. Benefits: strong authentication, encrypted communication, defense against MITM. Alternative to API keys/tokens для internal services.
