Centralized configuration storage для distributed applications. Spring Cloud Config, Consul, etcd serve configs over HTTP/API. Benefits: dynamic updates without restarts (hot reload), version control, audit trail, environment inheritance. Clients fetch config on startup или periodically refresh. Use cases: microservices configuration, feature flags, operational settings. High availability critical (config server down = deployment blocked). Encryption для sensitive values, access control per application/environment.
